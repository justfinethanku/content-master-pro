## reference images
some of the image gen models have the ability to recieve reference photos. that needs to be something I can incorporate. 
- the brand guidelines need to have different images references stored for persistant access (like the way we have it in thumbnail-generator app)
- I need to be able to attatch reference images when generating image assets
  

  ## text overflow throughout the app
  - we need to make sure we're importing modules, cards etc. 
  - we need to make sure text doesn't overflow their bounds

## research results 
- We need to figure out a way to save all research results to RAG. (pinecone) And really start building out a comprehensive resource 
- It would be something we would have to also incorporate into the search as well as when we first generate the brain dump summary, we should query the previous research documents.
